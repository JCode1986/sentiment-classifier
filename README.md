# Sentiment Classifier

**Author**: Joseph Hangarter
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
* Identify a dataset suitable for sentiment classification.
    * There are pre-prepared data-sets available that have sentiments included, are split into a training set and a testing set, and have a perfectly even distribution. For this lab, please find and prepare your own even if it is not perfect.
* Access it either externally or from within your repository as appropriate.
* Based on the shape of your data, determine an appropriate spread for your positive[2], neutral[1], and negative[0] sentiments and add a column associating them with the appropriate reviews.
* Identify and normalize any issues in your dataset.
* Do the preprocessing work utilizing Keras and Tensorflow taking a One-Hot Vector approach.
* In your readme, discuss the data set you choose, the distribution of your sentiments, your training/testing split, and the preprocessing methods you choose.

## Getting Started
* run `pipenv shell`
